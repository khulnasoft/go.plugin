## Overview

This collector monitors number of sessions and users as reported by the `org.freedesktop.login1` DBus API.




This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per systemd-logind users instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| logind.sessions | remote, local | sessions |
| logind.sessions_type | console, graphical, other | sessions |
| logind.sessions_state | online, closing, active | sessions |
| logind.users_state | offline, closing, online, lingering, active | users |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go/logind.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Khulnasoft [config directory](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/blob/master/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration.md#the-khulnasoft-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/khulnasoft 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/khulnasoft/etc/khulnasoft
sudo ./edit-config go/logind.conf
```
#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.


#### Examples
There are no configuration examples.



## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `logind` collector, run the `go.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/khulnasoft/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `khulnasoft.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/khulnasoft/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `khulnasoft` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u khulnasoft -s
  ```

- Run the `go.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.plugin -d -m logind
  ```
